- **Camera Settings**: Configure camera index, resolution, and FPS
- **Attendance Settings**: Set working hours and timeout periods
- **Security Settings**: Change admin password
- **Database Settings**: Configure database path and backup settings

## API Reference

### Main Classes

#### `AttendanceSystem`
Main application class that handles GUI and core functionality.

**Key Methods:**
- `start_camera()`: Initializes camera for face recognition
- `add_student()`: Adds new student to the system
- `mark_attendance()`: Records attendance for recognized students
- `generate_reports()`: Creates attendance reports

#### `Config`
Configuration management class.

**Key Methods:**
- `get_camera_settings()`: Returns camera configuration
- `get_face_recognition_settings()`: Returns face recognition settings
- `validate_config()`: Validates configuration parameters

## Database Schema

### Students Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `name`: Student name
- `roll_number`: Unique roll number
- `email`: Student email
- `phone`: Contact number
- `created_at`: Registration timestamp

### Attendance Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `student_id`: Foreign key to students table
- `date`: Attendance date
- `time_in`: Check-in time
- `time_out`: Check-out time (optional)
- `status`: Attendance status
- `created_at`: Record creation timestamp

### Face Encodings Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `student_id`: Foreign key to students table
- `encoding`: Face encoding data (binary)
- `image_path`: Path to student photo

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Not Working
- Check camera permissions
- Ensure no other application is using the camera
- Try different camera index in config.py

#### Face Recognition Not Accurate
